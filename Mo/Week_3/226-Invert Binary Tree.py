"""
Invert a binary tree.

Example:

Input:

         4
       /   \
      2     7
     / \   / \
    1   3 6   9
    
Output:

         4
       /   \
      7     2
     / \   / \
    9   6 3   1
    
Trivia:
This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:

Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.
